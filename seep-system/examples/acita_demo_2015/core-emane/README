This directory contains code and helper scripts to run Frontier on the CORE/EMANE wireless network emulator and on Raspberry Pi.

# CORE/EMANE setup.
See the setup scripts for installing the required packages on different versions of Ubuntu (see `ubuntu_*_setup.sh`)

You need to install:
Core 4.8
Emane
Nrlolsr
BonnMotion
Maven (you'll perhaps need to manually install soot-framework-2.5.0.jar into the local mvn repository
using the suggested mvn install ... when mvn clean compile assembly:single fails).
For 12.04 install olsrd 0.6.3 from ppa at https://launchpad.net/~guardianproject/+archive/ubuntu/commotion (Don't forget to update before installing!).
For 14.04 you can just install olsrd from apt-get directly.
python pandas
python utm

Several patches to Core (version 4.8) and Emane are required for it to work properly (see vldb/config/core*.py).
See vldb/config/etc-hosts-additions for hostnames to add to /etc/hosts.

The core configuration directory should also be symlinked from your home directory to point to vldb/config
Finally, the default core configuration file may need to be update to use an appropriate control net address (see e.g. vldb/config/core.4.8.koala8).

Tweaks to the default olsrd config may also be required.

# Pi Setup.
Set up an ssh key and add it to a local agent:
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_pi

Various network interface definition files can be found in vldb/config. You may need to overwrite the default interfaces definition on your pi.
cp /etc/network/interfaces{.adhoc,}

On some machines (e.g. desktops communicating with the pis) it may be required to disable network manager
edit /etc/NetworkManager.conf
managed=false
