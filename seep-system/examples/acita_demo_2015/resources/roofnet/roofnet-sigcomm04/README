These are the experiment data used for the Roofnet paper that appeared
in SIGCOMM 2004, "Link-Level Measurements from an 802.11b Mesh Network".

In each experiment, one Roofnet node sent 1500-byte broadcast packets
as fast as possible for 90 seconds.  Meanwhile, all other nodes in the
network listened and recorded which packets they received.

The files 'sent_packets_060624xx' and 'received_packets_060624xx' are
comma-delimited text files containing the raw results.  The sent_packets
file lists all the packets that were sent, and the received_packets file
lists all the packets that were received.  The summaries file provides
average delivery rate, over the 90s, for every pair of nodes in the
network.

The node_coordinates file lists the approximate latitude and longitude
of each of the participating nodes.


SENT PACKETS
  
  The fields in the sent_packets file are:
  
    exp_id,link_test,test_phase,src,seq,time
  
  The exp_id field is the experiment ID.  The traces provided here come
  from four experiments, 0606062400 through 0606062403, which correspond
  to bit-rates of 1, 2, 5.5 and 11 Mbits/s respectively.
  
  The link_test field is different for each broadcaster's turn.  It can
  basically be ignored, as the src field can be used to differentiate
  between tests.
  
  The test_phase field can also be ignored; it's used in some other
  experiments we've run, but isn't used for these broadcast tests.
  
  The src field is the node ID of the sender node.
  
  The seq field is a unique sequence number for each packet.
  
  The time field is the time at which the packet went to the outgoing
  interface on the sender, as measured by the sender's clock.  Note that
  the clocks on the nodes are only loosely synchronized, to within a
  few seconds.
  

RECEIVED PACKETS
  
  The fields in the received_packets file are:
  
    exp_id,link_test,test_phase,src,dst,seq,time,signal,noise
  
  The exp_id, link_test, test_phase, src, and seq fields correspond to
  the same fields in the sent packets log.
  
  The dst field is the node ID of the node that received this packet.
  
  The time field is the time at which this packet was received, as measured
  by the receiving node's clock.
  
  The signal and noise fields are the signal and noise (a.k.a. 'silence')
  values which are reported by the 802.11 card.
 

SUMMARIES
  
  The fields in the summaries file are:
  
    exp_id,link_test,test_phase,src,dst,delivery_ratio,signal,noise
  
  The exp_id, link_test, test_phase, src, and dst fields are the same as
  in the sent and received packets logs.
  
  The delivery_ratio is the fraction of packets sent by src that were
  received by dst.
  
  The signal and noise are average values for all received packets.
  

NODE COORDINATES
  
  The fields in the node coordinates file are:
  
  node_id,latitude,longitude
  
  The coordinates are approximate, based on the street address of the
  building that hosts the node.
